# The in-project code generator

Ask 10 different developers how they'd structure their code, and they'll give you 10 different answers.

## Purpose

Boilerplating and templating is great, but sometimes, you just want a little piece boilerplated and scaffolded, not an entire project. Sprout was made to be an in-project code generator that's agnostic to whatever or however your team likes to generate code.
